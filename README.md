## Target Search Script for ChEMBL API

This Python script automates the process of searching for molecular targets using the ChEMBL API and saves the results to CSV files. Itâ€™s useful for researchers or developers working on drug discovery, target validation, or bioinformatics analysis.

### Features
- **Search ChEMBL Targets:** Search for protein or enzyme targets by name (e.g., "alpha-glucosidase").
- **Dynamic CSV Export:** Save target data, including ChEMBL IDs and preferred names, to organized CSV files.
- **Directory Management:** Automatically creates the output directory if it doesnâ€™t exist.
- **Error Handling:** Catches and reports errors during API queries.

### Usage
1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install chembl-webresource-client pandas
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   Edit the `query_list` in the `main` function to include your search terms.
   
   ```python
   query_list = ['alpha_glucosidase', 'ppar_gamma']
   ```

3. **Execute the Script:**
   ```bash
   python search_targets.py
   ```

4. **Check Results:**
   The results will be saved as CSV files, named based on the search terms (e.g., `targets_alpha-glucosidase.csv`).

### File Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ search_targets.py
â”œâ”€â”€ targets_alpha-glucosidase.csv
â””â”€â”€ targets_ppar-gamma.csv
```

### Example Output
| target_chembl_id | pref_name         | search_term        |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| CHEMBL123456      | Alpha-glucosidase | alpha-glucosidase  |
| CHEMBL654321      | PPAR gamma        | ppar-gamma         |

### Notes
- Ensure you have an active internet connection to access the ChEMBL API.
- Modify the output directory by changing `job_dir` in the `main` function.

This script provides a simple yet powerful way to access and store target data for further analysis. Let me know if youâ€™d like me to add more features or optimize the workflow! ðŸš€
